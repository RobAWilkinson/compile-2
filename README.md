#Compile2 

This repo can help you play around with compile to languages without having to worry about setting up build tools.

`npm install`

I have 4 different gulp tasks set up

1. `gulp sass`
1. `gulp less`
1. `gulp coffee`
1. `gulp typescript`

When you run them it compiles the respective language and saves it into the output folder.

The css and the js file are loaded into the `output/index.html`

I encourage you to play around with each one and see if there are any features you like.

Who knows, you might even end up using one of them for your project :o)

(You might want to hang onto the gulpfile to as a reference for future projects)
